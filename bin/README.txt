The setup_test.sh script will move all of the files
needed to setup our project in a directory recognized
by Apache. 

Set the SITE variable to be the path to the directory
of our website in the web root.

Set the PROJECT variable to be the path to the home 
directory for the project on your system. This will
hopefully be outside the web root.

Navigate to the bin directory of the project and run:
./setup_test.sh
