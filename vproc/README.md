#### Video processing and data file storage components of project.  
`./deliver` contains components that make an exe that fulfills project requirments related to processing the video and storing data like video metadata (frame count, fps, width, height), 68 landmarks, pupils, and pose in a file.  
See the readme there for how to build it.    
Most of the other stuff here is me experimenting/testing.
